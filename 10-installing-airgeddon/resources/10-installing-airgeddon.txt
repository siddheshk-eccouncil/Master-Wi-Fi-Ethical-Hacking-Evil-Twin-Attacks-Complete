Get airgeddon from here:

https://github.com/v1s1t0r1sh3r3/airgeddon

open a terminal and type;:

git clone https://github.com/v1s1t0r1sh3r3/airgeddon.git

Then enter the airgeddon folder:

cd airgeddon

and then run the airgeddon script:

./airgeddon.sh

The above script is how you start airgeddon each time.
 

You can install all the missing programs automatically by
pressing Enter after airgeddon checks the files, or
you can install them manually one by one as follows:

beef-xss and hostapd-wpe are optional and you
can skip them.

apt-get install asleap
apt-get install bettercap
apt-get install mdk4
apt-get install hostapd
apt-get install beef-xss  [optional]
apt-get install lighttpd
apt-get install isc-dhcp-server
apt-get install dnsspoof

If you get any errors during the installation saying that
certain dependencies are missing, just go ahead
and install those missing dependencies by typing
apt-get install dependency-name
